train_set : The training set

test_set : The test set

merged_data : the merged training and test sets such that the test set is below the training set

features : data frame containing the features along with their serial numbers

features_mean : features having the measurements on mean for each measurement

features_std : features having the measurements on standard deviation for each measurement

features_mean_std : row bind of features_mean and feautres_std such that the data set features_mean_std now contains the features having measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement

indices : the serial nos of the data set containing only the measurements on mean and standard deviation

merged_data_mean_std : the data set containing the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement such that they are sorted according to the serial number

train_label : the training labels

test_label : the test labels

label : row bind of training and test labels

activity_labels : the activity names along with their labels

activity : mapping of the activities to the labels corresponding to the data set containing the measurements

activity_merged_data_mean_std : mapping of the activities to the data set containing measurements

subject_train : the training data set specifying the subject on whom the measurement was made

subject_test : the test data set specifying the subject on whom the measurement was made

subject : row binding of subject_train and subject_test

subject_activity_merged_data_mean_std : data set specifying the measurements of only mean and standard deviation such that the subject on whom the measurement and the activity he was performing is also mapped

avg_subject_activity : the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
